  "paragraphs": [
    "After gathering some spare PC components, I decided it was time to dive into Proxmox and build my own server. With a second GPU lent to me by a good friend, I had everything I needed to set up a system designed for hosting services and experimenting with AI. This was my first time working with a hypervisor like Proxmox, and the process of installing and configuring it was both challenging and incredibly rewarding.",
    "Today, I got the server up and running. It’s already hosting a few VMs, and I’m planning to add some containers soon. I’m particularly excited about using this setup to run AI workloads and experiment with virtual environments. Proxmox is proving to be an excellent tool for managing resources and keeping everything organized."
