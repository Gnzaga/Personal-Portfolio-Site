    "summary": "I'm excited to share that I've started a new role as Platform Engineer for Anti-Spam Systems at Verizon, where I'm architecting next-generation adaptive platforms to protect 100M+ messaging endpoints using AI/ML, agentic automation, and vector search.",

      "I'm thrilled to announce that I've embarked on an exciting new journey as Platform Engineer for Anti-Spam Systems at Verizon! This role represents a significant evolution in my career, combining my passion for infrastructure automation, AI/ML, and security engineering to tackle one of the most challenging problems in modern telecommunications.",
      "In this position, I'm architecting Verizon's internal next-generation adaptive anti-spam platform that integrates AI/ML, agentic automation, and vector search to secure over 100 million messaging endpoints across internal and inter-carrier networks. The scale and impact of this work is incredible—we're protecting communications for millions of users every single day.",
      "One of my first major accomplishments was delivering a comprehensive system vision within just two weeks. I designed the architecture, identified the potential technology stack (Redis, Milvus, BigQuery, Apache Nifi), and presented a two-hour technical briefing to our AI, Data, and Platform organizations. It was an intense but incredibly rewarding experience to synthesize complex requirements into a cohesive vision.",
      "A major win early on was replacing legacy OpenStack+Heat workflows with Terraform-based VM orchestration. This change was transformational—we reduced large-scale deployment time from 3-4 hours for just 6 VMs to only 5 minutes for 62 VMs. This kind of efficiency improvement enables us to scale our infrastructure rollout dramatically.",
      "What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to evolve our approach from purely defensive to offensive, intelligence-generating capabilities. I've proposed AI/ML-driven techniques that incorporate adversarial simulation and honeypot engagement, transforming how we think about anti-spam and abuse detection. Instead of just blocking threats, we're building systems that learn from them and generate actionable intelligence.",
      "The collaborative aspect of this work has been phenomenal. I'm working across AI/ML, Security, and Platform teams to unify orchestration, streaming data ingestion, and model evaluation pipelines. We're establishing shared frameworks for feature engineering, explainability, and continuous tuning—all backed by senior executive sponsorship. It's rare to have this level of organizational alignment and support.",
      "This role brings together everything I've learned about infrastructure automation, cloud platforms, networking, and now adds cutting-edge AI/ML and security dimensions. Every day presents new challenges and opportunities to push the boundaries of what's possible in anti-spam technology.",
      "I'm incredibly grateful for the experiences that prepared me for this role - from my time as a Network Engineer working on edge automation to my personal homelab projects exploring AI/ML workloads. All of these experiences are coming together in this new chapter, and I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead!"
