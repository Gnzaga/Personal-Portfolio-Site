## Getting Started
----------------

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, and then customized to meet my needs.

## About This Setup
-------------------

We chose to use the following technologies for this project:

* **Create React App**: A popular tool for setting up new React projects with ease.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies the process of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable CSS code.
* **Docker**: A containerization platform that allows us to deploy our application in a robust and scalable way.
* **Cloudflare**: A high-performance infrastructure provider that offers built-in security features.

## How It Works
----------------

Here's an overview of how this setup works:

1. **Create React App** creates a new React project with all required dependencies pre-configured.
2. **Tailwind CSS** provides a simple, utility-first approach to styling our application.
3. **Docker** containerizes the application for robust deployment and scalability.
4. **Cloudflare** provides a secure, high-performance infrastructure for serving the website.

## Deployment
-------------

My deployment process involves building the project using Create React App, creating a Docker image from the built code, and then deploying that image to Cloudflare.
